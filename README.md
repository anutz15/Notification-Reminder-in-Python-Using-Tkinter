# Notification-Reminder-in-Python
Collaborative project - Anuj Shah,Aditya Pachigar & Dev Sanger.
This project is about a Notification reminder program coded in Python.

In this Project, I have used Tkinter library of Python to create a dialog type reminder and it notifies and store information about your notification in a table, and if you want to delete it you can do so.
